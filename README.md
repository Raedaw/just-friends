Just Friends is a react js app designed to connect people with others who have the same
interests and passions in the local area. This can be a great way to make new friends when
new to an area and become part of the community. We decided to put the user into groups, as
opposed to 1-2-1, both for safety reasons and for an overall  more comfortable experience.
Being 1-2-1 can be quite intense, and there is not guarantee you will connect with that
individual, but being in a group can provide more opportunities to create a connection and
create friendship groups.
